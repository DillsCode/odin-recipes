    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ pound bulk Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 (1 pound) loaf frozen bread dough, thawed</li>
        <li>9 large eggs, divided</li>
        <li>½ pound sliced mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>½ pound sliced cooked ham</li>
        <li>½ pound sliced provolone cheese</li>
        <li>½ pound sliced salam</li>
        <li>½ pound sliced pepperoni</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) container ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook and stir Italian sausage in a skillet over medium heat until browned and crumbly, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain excess grease; set sausage aside.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Oil the bottom and sides of a 10-inch springform pan with olive oil.</li>
        <li>Cut 1/3 of the dough off the loaf and set aside under a cloth. Form the remaining dough into a ball; roll ball on a floured work surface into a 14-inch circle. Press circle into the bottom and up the sides of the prepared springform pan; excess dough will hand over the edges.</li>
        <li>Whisk 8 eggs in a 2-cup liquid measure.</li>
        <li>Working with only 1/2 of the ingredients at a time, make layers in the pan in the following order: sausage, mozzarella, ham, provolone, salami, pepperoni, ricotta, and Parmesan. Pour in 1/2 of the beaten eggs. Repeat layers once more, starting with sausage and ending with Parmesan. Pour remaining beaten eggs over top.</li>
        <li>Roll out remaining bread dough into a 12-inch circle. Place over the pie to form a top crust. Roll and pinch any overhanging bottom crust over top crust to seal in the filling.</li>
        <li>Beat remaining egg and water in a small bowl. Brush egg wash over top crust.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the crust is golden brown and the filling is set, 50 to 60 minutes. A toothpick inserted into the middle of the crust should come out without any raw egg.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and cool in the pan for at least 25 minutes, then release the spring and remove pie from the pan. Transfer to a serving platter and cut into wedges for serving.</li>
    </ol>
