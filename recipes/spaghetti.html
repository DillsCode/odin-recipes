    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces uncooked thick spaghetti</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 pound bay scallops</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons grated lemon zest</li>
        <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>â…“ cup dry sherry</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped Italian parsley, divided</li>
        <li>Freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes or 1 minute less than directed on the package.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. When oil just starts to smoke, add scallops and move them into a single layer. Let sear on high for about 1 minute. Toss to turn.</li>
        <li>Add butter and stir scallops until butter melts. Stir in garlic.</li>
        <li>Add lemon zest and red pepper flakes. Stir in sherry and cook and stir until alcohol cooks off, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pour in cream. When mixture begins to simmer, reduce heat to medium-low. Add salt, pepper, and lemon juice.</li>
        <li>Drain pasta. Transfer to skillet with scallops; bring to a simmer. Add 1/2 of the chopped parsley. Cook until pasta is heated through and tender, about 1 minute.</li>
    </ol>
